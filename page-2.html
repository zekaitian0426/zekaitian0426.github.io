		<h2>Shot 222-240: Woman's story</h2>
		<p>One of the most memoreable scenes in this film is the scene where the woman, after being raped 
			by the bandit and being discarded, went to unlease her husband samurai who 
			was tied to a pine tree. The samurai, instead of happily reuniting with his 
			beloved wife, demeaned his wife for her loss of purity. </p>
		<p>The dramatic tension of this scene is not only told through stories, but also 
			through cinematography. Here we will provide the shot list of this scene, and
			briefly analyze the effects of each shots on leveling the dramatic tension up.
