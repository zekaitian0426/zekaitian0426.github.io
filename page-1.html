			<h1>About the Film</h1>
			<p>Rashomon (Japanese: 羅生門, Hepburn: Rashōmon) is a 1950 Jidaigeki 
				drama film directed and written by Akira Kurosawa, 
				Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyō, and Takashi Shimura 
				as various people who describe how a samurai was murdered in a forest, the plot and characters are 
				based upon Ryunosuke Akutagawa's short story "In a Grove", 
				with the title and framing story being based on "Rashōmon", 
				another short story by Akutagawa. Every element is largely identical, 
				from the murdered samurai speaking through a Shinto psychic to
				the bandit in the forest, the monk, the assault of the wife and 
				the dishonest retelling of the events in which everyone shows 
				their ideal self by lying.</p>
			<p>Throuhout the film, regarding the death of the samurai, four different versions of
				stories are told from the bandit, the woman, the samurai, and the 
				woodcutter. 
					<ul>
						<li>
							Story #1 <br>
							The bandit forced the woman, but the woman eventually accepted. 
							The woman demanded a combat between the two men, 
							and fled away during the fight. Samurai was killed 
							by the bandit. The bandit respected the samurai. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Story #2 <br>
							The woman was raped by the bandit. She freed the samurai, 
							but the samurai, instead of gratitude, demeaned her 
							for losing her dignitiy and not clean. The woman 
							couldn't stand it, wanting him to kill her, but he 
							still didn't move, just looking down on her. 
							She couldn't take it anymore, and blacked out. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Story #3 <br>
							After the rape, samurai's wife decided to go with the 
							bandit, and wanted the bandit to kill the samurai. 
							Shocked by it, the bandit abandoned the wife, 
							leaving her to the samurai (samurai forgave his 
							guilt since then). The woman fled away. The bandit 
							returned to free the samurai since he knew he will 
							be soon captured by the police. The samurai, being 
							so shamed, suicided using his wife's dagger. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Story #4 <br>
							After the rape, the samurai begged the woman to be 
							his wife, but the wife demands a combat. 
							But the samurai not even wanted to fight, 
							since such a woman is not what he wanted. 
							The wife then verbally attack the two men for 
							being cowards. They then forced to fight, and the 
							samurai was killed.
						</li>
					</ul>

			<h1>About the Director</h1>
			<p class = "director">
			Japanese director <b>Akira Kurosawa</b>
			can be said to be one of the most
			important directors in film history. He is mostly known for his artistic
			camera movements, and his unique narration styles -- they are all reflected
			in <em>Rashomon</em> very well. 
			His camera movements can be sumamrized as having following charactersitics:<br>
				<ul class = "director">
					<li>Movement of nature. He likes to cover scenic movements, like 
						winds, raindrops, snowflakes, tree leaves, etc. </li>
					<li>Movement of groups. He likes to include multiple people in one shot, 
						and to show the movements of crowds. For example, group of people turning heads
						toward the same direction.</li>
					<li>Unbroken take. He prefers master shots and Oner over frequent 
						editings. Each of his shots have a clear beggining, middle and end. </li>
				</ul>
